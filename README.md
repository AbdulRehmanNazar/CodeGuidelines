# CodeGuidelines
Guidelines that should be followed when writing code

### Class Name:
Class name always starts with a Capital character, for example, there is a class called “User” then U should be capital, Class name as user is wrong.

### Method Name:
Method names always follow Camel case in which the first character is small and next Word will be capital, for example, we have method name getUserName. g character should be small and next U of User is Capital and so on.
Compose functions are exceptional cases.

### Code Redundancy:
To avoid code redundancy if a code snippet that contains more than 2 lines and is used in more than 1 place ,then convert into a method and call it.

### Constants:
Define all Constants in a single file, for example Privacy URLs etc

### Gradle file
Define all API URLs and keys inside Build file for security
